# Pythonista (Homework) Timer

This is a small script originally designed for tracking amount of time spent on homework. However, with a few tweaks (just change the `subjects` list at the top of the main file), it can be made to time pretty much anything you'd like.

Before using, make sure to set `db_path` to the actual path where you would like your database file created. (If you don't have a directory called `db` in your project folder, the script will fail.)

That said, note that this is a highly individualized script made for a very specific purpose. For instance, it only records the day of each entry (not the time), and timing is performed only with second precision. There are also a number of data displays that might not make sense for your particular use case.
