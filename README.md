# Pythonista (Homework) Timer

This is a small script originally designed for timing amount of time spent on homework. However, with a few tweaks to the UI file (no code required!), it can be made to time pretty much anything you'd like.

That said, note that this is a highly individualized script made for a very specific purpose. For instance, it only records the day of each entry (not the time), and timing is performed only with second precision. There are also a number of data displays that might not make sense for your particular use case.
